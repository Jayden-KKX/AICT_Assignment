Bayesian Network Structure:
- 7 variables with probabilistic dependencies
- Models relationship between mode, time, station type, and crowding
- Uses Variable Elimination for exact inference
- CPTs based on domain knowledge and MRT operational patterns

Key Findings:
1. Peak hours significantly increase crowding risk across all scenarios
2. Interchange stations have higher crowding than regular stations
3. Future mode with major network changes affects passenger flow patterns
4. T5 availability helps distribute airport passenger load
5. Off-peak periods show lower crowding regardless of network changes

Limitations:
- Data sparsity: CPT probabilities are estimates, not real data
- Discretization: Continuous variables (time, passenger count) discretized
- Independence assumptions: Some correlated factors may be missed
- Static model: Does not adapt to dynamic changes during operation
- Simplified scope: Focuses on subset of factors affecting crowding
