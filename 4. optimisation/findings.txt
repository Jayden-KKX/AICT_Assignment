Optimization Approach: Simulated Annealing
- Objective: Minimize total travel time across all OD pairs
- Constraints: Max 3 transfers, avoid disrupted segments
- State representation: Set of routes for each OD pair
- Neighborhood moves: Modify one route by finding alternative paths
- Stopping criteria: Fixed iterations with temperature cooling

Techniques Demonstrated:
1. Local Search: Iteratively improve solution by exploring neighbors
2. Hill Climbing: Accept better solutions, restart when stuck
3. Simulated Annealing: Accept worse solutions probabilistically to escape local minima

Key Results:
- Optimization successfully finds alternative routes avoiding disruptions
- Simulated annealing escapes local minima better than hill climbing
- Re-routing reduces overall travel time despite disruptions
- Algorithm adapts to different disruption scenarios

Limitations:
- May get stuck in local minima (though SA helps)
- Sensitive to penalty parameters (transfer cost, delay cost)
- Computational cost grows with number of OD pairs
- Simplified capacity model (no hard capacity constraints)
- Static optimization (does not adapt in real-time)
