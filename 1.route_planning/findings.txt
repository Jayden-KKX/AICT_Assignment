ANALYSIS & DISCUSSION

1. BREADTH-FIRST SEARCH (BFS)
   Advantages:
   - Guarantees shortest path in terms of number of stations
   - Systematic level-by-level exploration
   - Complete: will find solution if it exists
   Disadvantages:
   - Does not consider edge costs (travel time)
   - High memory usage (stores all nodes at current level)
   - May expand many unnecessary nodes

2. DEPTH-FIRST SEARCH (DFS)
   Advantages:
   - Low memory usage (only stores current path)
   - Fast for finding any solution
   Disadvantages:
   - Does NOT guarantee optimal path
   - May explore very long paths first
   - Can miss shorter alternatives

3. GREEDY BEST-FIRST SEARCH (GBFS)
   Advantages:
   - Uses heuristic to guide search toward goal
   - Often finds solutions quickly
   - Expands fewer nodes than uninformed search
   Disadvantages:
   - Does NOT guarantee optimal path
   - Quality depends on heuristic accuracy
   - Can be misled by heuristic

4. A* SEARCH
   Advantages:
   - Guarantees optimal path (with admissible heuristic)
   - Balances actual cost and heuristic estimate
   - Most efficient optimal search algorithm
   Disadvantages:
   - Requires more memory than GBFS
   - Slower than GBFS for large networks
   - Needs good heuristic for best performance

5. TODAY vs FUTURE MODE COMPARISON
   - Future mode provides direct TEL connection to Changi Airport
   - T5 interchange (TE32/CR1) enables better connectivity
   - TELe reduces transfer requirements for many routes
   - Conversion of EWL Changi branch to TEL integrates network better
   - Travel times generally reduced in Future mode due to direct connections
