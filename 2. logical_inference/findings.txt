Logical Inference System:
- Uses propositional logic with resolution-based inference
- Rules encoded in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF)
- Can detect contradictions in advisory sets
- Validates routes against operational constraints
- Supports both Today and Future network modes

Key Rules Implemented:
1. Systems integration → service adjustments required
2. Tanah Merah conversion → require alternative paths
3. TELe operational → Changi accessible via TEL (Future mode)
4. T5 accessible → both TEL and CRL available (Future mode)
5. Peak hours → crowding penalties active
6. Interchange transfer → minimum 3-minute transfer time
7. Conversion complete → EWL Changi stations become TEL (Future mode)

Limitations:
- Propositional logic cannot express complex temporal relationships
- Rule base requires manual encoding of domain knowledge
- Resolution can be computationally expensive for large rule sets
- Cannot handle probabilistic or uncertain information
